Blurb:: Specify the situations where numerical optimization is used for MFMC sample allocation

Description::
Multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) supports an analytic solution for the
allocation of samples per model instance based on response correlations and
relative simulation cost.  In some situations (over-estimated pilot sample,
mis-ordered model correlations), this analytic solution may be either
sub-optimal or undefined, requiring mitigation.

This specification allows for control of this mitigation; in particular,
whether recourse to a numerical solution is strictly a fallback (default)
or is desired as an unconditional override (regardless of the need for
specific mitigations).

Further, when a numerical solve is employed, it can utilize either the
\c sqp or \c nip solver options.

<b> Default Behavior </b>
Analytic is preferred, with \c fallback to numerical only when mitigation
is required.
