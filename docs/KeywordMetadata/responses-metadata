Blurb:: (Experimental) Labels for floating point response metadata

Description::

Specify the labels (field names) for floating point-valued metadata
responses to be returned from the interface.

Dakota's emerging metadata responses are distinct from the response
quantities of interest explored by a Dakota \ref method. Some, such as
simulation cost might be used by a method (such as
method-multifidelity_sampling and related methods) to make algorithmic
decisions. Other metadata might just be tabulated for user
convenience.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

In a \ref interface-analysis_drivers-fork-results_file, values and
labels for metadata should follow any function values, gradients, or
Hessians returned by the simulation.

Topics::

Examples::

A responses specification where the Dakota method will be applied to
quantities of interest stress and displacement, while metadata
simulation cost in minutes and number of dead elements will be
tabulated for each evaluation:

\verbatim
responses
  descriptors 'stress' 'displacement'
  response_functions 2
  no_gradients
  no_hessians
  metadata 'simulation_cost_minutes' 'number_dead_elements'

\endverbatim
