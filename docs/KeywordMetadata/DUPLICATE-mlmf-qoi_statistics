Blurb:: Return the quantity of interest (QoI) statistics as the final results of a UQ method

Description:: In most nested execution contexts, the outer loop is operating
on the set of moments and level mappings returned by an inner loop UQ method.
Thus \c qoi_statistics is the default.

Sub-specifications include the type of \c final_moments (\c none, \c standard,
or \c central) and the sense of \c distribution functions (\c cumulative or
\c complementary).
