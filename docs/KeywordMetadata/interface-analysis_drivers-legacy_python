Blurb::
Run Python through a deprecated C-based direct interface - requires a special Dakota build

Description::
This interface has been
superseded by a Pybind11 implementation \ref interface-analysis_drivers-python .

%Dakota supports a library-linked interface to Python, but it must be
explicitly enabled when compiling %Dakota from source.
The \ref interface-analysis_drivers keyword specifies a Python module:function
which implements the parameter to response mapping.  List data
structures are the default, but NumPy is also supported, if enabled in
the build.
