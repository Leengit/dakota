Job Submission (Run Configuration Option)

.. note::

   The Job Submission run configuration - while useful - can be somewhat overwhelming to set up, as well as ultimately limiting for what it enables you to do on remote machines.
   Please consider using the :ref:`remoteNestedWorkflow node in Next-Gen Workflow <gui-job-submission-workflow>` to achieve the same result, as well as use NGW-based workflows
   on remote machines.
