Number of designs returned as the best solutions
Description::
The ``final_solutions`` controls the number of final solutions
returned by the iterator as the best solutions.

For most optimizers, this is one, but some optimizers
can produce multiple solutions (e.g. genetic algorithms).

When using a ``hybrid`` strategy, the number of final
solutions dictates how many solutions are passed from
one method to another.

Examples::
In the case of sampling methods, if one
specifies 100 samples (for example) but also specifies
``final_solutions`` = 5, the five best solutions (in
order of lowest response function value) are returned.
