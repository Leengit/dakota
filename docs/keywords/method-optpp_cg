Blurb::
A conjugate gradient optimization method
Description::
The conjugate gradient method is an implementation of the
Polak-Ribiere approach and handles only unconstrained problems.

See :ref:`topic-package_optpp<topic-package_optpp>` for info related to all ``optpp`` methods.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:ref:`environment-results_output-hdf5<environment-results_output-hdf5>` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs` (when :ref:`responses-objective_functions<responses-objective_functions>`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration` (when :ref:`responses-calibration_terms<responses-calibration_terms>` are specified)
