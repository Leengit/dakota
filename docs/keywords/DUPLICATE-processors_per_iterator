Specify the number of processors per iterator server when Dakota is run in parallel
Description::
An important feature for component-based iterators is that execution
of sub-iterator runs may be performed concurrently. The optional
``processors_per_iterator`` specification supports user override
of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of processors in each
iterator server. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired server size
at the iterator parallelism level. Currently, ``hybrid``, ``multi_start``,
and ``pareto_set`` component-based iterators support concurrency in their
sub-iterators. Refer to ParallelLibrary and the Parallel Computing chapter
of the Users Manual :cite:p:`UsersMan` for additional information.
