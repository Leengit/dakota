Aleatory uncertain discrete variable - geometric

Description::
The geometric distribution represents the number of successful trials that might occur before a failure is observed.

The density function for the geometric distribution is given by:

.. math:: f(x) = {p}{(1-p)^{x}},

where :math:`p` is the probability of failure per trial.
