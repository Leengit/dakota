Tracks the average fitness of the population
Description::
The ``convergence_type`` called ``average_fitness_tracker`` keeps track
of the average fitness in a population. If this average fitness does
not change more than ``percent_change`` over some number of
generations, ``num_generations``, then the solution is reported as
converged and the algorithm terminates.
