Uses purely random Monte Carlo sampling to sample variables
Description::
The ``random`` keyword invokes Monte Carlo sampling as the means of
drawing samples of uncertain variables according to their probability
distributions.

*Default Behavior*

In most contexts, Monte Carlo sampling is not the default sampling mode
(exception: multilevel_sampling).  To change this behavior, the
``random`` keyword must be specified in conjuction with the ``sample_type``
keyword.

*Usage Tips*

Monte Carlo sampling is more computationally expensive than Latin
Hypercube Sampling as it requires a larger number of samples to
accurately estimate statistics.
