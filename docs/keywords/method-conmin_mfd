CONMIN method of feasible directions
Description::
The interpretations of the method independent controls for CONMIN are
essentially identical to those for DOT.

See :ref:`topic-package_dot<topic-package_dot>` for information related to ``CONMIN``
methods, specifically :ref:`method-dot_mmfd<method-dot_mmfd>`.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:ref:`environment-results_output-hdf5<environment-results_output-hdf5>` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs` (when :ref:`responses-objective_functions<responses-objective_functions>`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_constraints`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration` (when :ref:`responses-calibration_terms<responses-calibration_terms>` are specified)
