Absolute convergence tolerance
Description::
``absolute_conv_tol`` (NL2SOL's
``afctol``) is the absolute function convergence tolerance (stop when half
the sum of squares is less than ``absolute_conv_tol``, which is mainly
of interest on zero-residual test problems).

The internal default is a function of machine epsilon
(as limited by ``function_precision``). The default is selected with a value of -1.
