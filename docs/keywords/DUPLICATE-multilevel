Blurb::
Use the multilevel MCMC algorithm.
Description::
Selects the multilevel algorithm described in :cite:p:`Prudencio`.

*Default Behavior*

Five MCMC algorithm variants are supported: ``dram``,
``delayed_rejection``, ``adaptive_metropolis``, ``metropolis_hastings``, and
``multilevel``.  The default is ``dram``.

*Usage Tips*

The multilevel algorithm is a more experimental algorithm than the
other MCMC approaches mentioned above.  It works well in cases where
the prior can be "evolved" to a posterior in a structured way.
Currently, the multilevel option is not in production form.
