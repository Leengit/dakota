Blurb::
Write results to file in text format
Description::
When this keyword is present, Dakota will right (some) final
method results to disk in a custom structured text format instead
of just to the console. Support for text format results output
will be deprecated in a future release, and the contents and
organization of the output file is subject to change.

The default name of the file is ``dakota_results``.txt. This can
be changed using the ``results_output_file`` keyword.
