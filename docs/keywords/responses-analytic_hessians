Hessians are needed and are available directly from the analysis driver
Description::
The ``analytic_hessians`` specification means that Hessian information
is available directly from the simulation. The simulation must return
the Hessian data in the Dakota format (enclosed in double brackets;
see Dakota File Data Formats in Users Manual :cite:p:`UsersMan`) for the
case of file transfer of data. The ``analytic_hessians`` keyword is a
complete specification for this case.
