Blurb::
Selection of a random number generator
Description::
The ``rng`` keyword is used to indicate a choice of random number generator.

*Default Behavior*

If specified, the ``rng`` keyword must be accompanied by either
``rnum2`` (pseudo-random numbers) or ``mt19937`` (random numbers generated
by the Mersenne twister).  Otherwise, ``mt19937``, the Mersenne twister
is used by default.

*Usage Tips*

The default is recommended, as the Mersenne twister is a higher
quality random number generator.
