Blurb::
Group to specify nonlinear inequality constraints
Description::
Specifies the number of nonlinear inequality constraint functions
returned by the interface.

The ``lower_bounds`` and ``upper_bounds`` specifications provide the
lower and upper bounds for 2-sided nonlinear inequalities of the form

.. math:: g_l \leq g(x) \leq g_u

When constraint bounds are not specified, the problem is assumed to
have one-sided inequalities bounded above by zero:

.. math:: g(x) \leq 0.0.

This provides backwards compatibility with previous Dakota versions.

In a user bounds specification, any upper bound values greater than
````+bigRealBoundSize (1.e+30, as defined in Minimizer) are treated as
+infinity and any lower bound values less than ``-bigRealBoundSize``
are treated as -infinity. This feature is commonly used to drop one of
the bounds in order to specify a 1-sided constraint (just as the
default lower bounds drop out since ``-DBL_MAX`` <

``-bigRealBoundSize``). The same approach is used for nonexistent linearinequality bounds and for nonexistent design variable bounds.

The ``scale_types`` and ``scales`` keywords are related to scaling of
:math:`g \left( x \right)` .  See the scaling information under
specific methods, e.g., method-\*-scaling for details on how to use
this keyword.
