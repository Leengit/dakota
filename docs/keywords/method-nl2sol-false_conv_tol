False convergence tolerance
Description::
``false_conv_tol`` (NL2SOL's ``xftol``) is the
false-convergence tolerance (stop with a suspicion of discontinuity
when a more favorable stopping test is not satisfied and a step of
scaled length at most ``false_conv_tol`` is not accepted)

The internal default is a function of machine epsilon
(as limited by ``function_precision``). The default is selected with a value of -1.
