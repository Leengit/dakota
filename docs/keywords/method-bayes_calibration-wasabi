(Experimental Method) Non-MCMC Bayesian inference using interval analysis
Description::
Offers an alternative to Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian
inference.  This is a nascent capability, not yet ready for production
use.

*Usage Guidelines:* The WASABI method requires an emulator model.

*Attention:* While the ``emulator`` specification for WASABI
includes the keyword posterior_adaptive, it is not yet operational.
