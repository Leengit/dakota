Blurb::
(Initial) polynomial order of each univariate function within the functional tensor train.
Description::
This specifies the initial polynomial order of each univariate function that makes up the functional tensor train decomposition.  In the case of ``adapt_order``, polynomial order starts from this value and is then advanced; its maximum value is limited by ``max_order`` and increments are controlled by ``kick_order``.
