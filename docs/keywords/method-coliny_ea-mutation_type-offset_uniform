Set mutation offset to use a uniform distribution
Description::
The ``offset_uniform`` type is an "offset" mutation that adds a 0-mean random
variable with a uniform distribution to the existing coordinate value.
The offset is limited in magnitude by ``mutation_scale``

For discrete design variables, ``offset_uniform`` is always used, and
``mutation_range`` controls the magnitude of the mutation.
