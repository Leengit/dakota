This describes the behavior of reuse of points in constructing polynomial
chaos expansion models.
Description::
The ``reuse_points`` option controls the reuse behavior of points for various types of polynomial chaos expansions, including: ``collocation_points``,
``collocation_ratio``, ``expansion_samples``, or ``orthogonal_least_interpolation``.  If any of these approaches are specified to create a set of points
for the polynomial chaos expansion, one can specify ``reuse_points`` so that any points that have been previously generated (for example, from the ``import_points`` file) can be reused.
