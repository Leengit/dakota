Blurb::
Number of samples at which to evaluate an emulator (surrogate)
Description::
How many approximate function evaluations to perform on the emulator
model, e.g., to compute statistics

*Default Behavior*

The default number of samples is method-dependent.
Topics::

Examples::
Perform 10000 samples on the PCE approximation of the true model:

.. code-block::

    method
      polynomial_chaos
        quadrature_order    = 2
        samples_on_emulator = 10000
