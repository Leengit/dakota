Allow refinement of probability and generalized reliability results using importance sampling
Description::
The ``probability_refinement`` allows refinement of probability and generalized reliability results using importance sampling. If one specifies ``probability_refinement``, there are some additional options.  One can specify which type of importance sampling to use ( ``import``, ``adapt_import``, or ``mm_adapt_import``). Additionally, one can specify the number of refinement samples to use with ``.refinement_samples`` and the seed to use with ``seed``.

The ``probability_refinement`` density reweighting accounts originally
was developed based on Gaussian distributions.  It now accounts for
additional non-Gaussian cases.
