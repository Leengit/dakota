String-valued discrete state set variables

Description::
Discrete state variables whose values come from a specified set of
admissible strings. 

See :ref:`variables:usage` for tips on specifying discrete set
variables and :ref:`variables:state` for details on the behavior
of state variables.

Each string element value must be quoted and may contain alphanumeric,
dash, underscore, and colon. White space, quote characters, and
backslash/metacharacters are not permitted.
