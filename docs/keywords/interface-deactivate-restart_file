Deactivate writing to the restart file
Description::
Eliminate the output of each new function evaluation to the binary
restart file. This can increase speed and reduce disk storage
requirements, but at the expense of a loss in the ability to recover
and continue a run that terminates prematurely (e.g., due to a system
crash or network problem).

*Usage Tips*


- This option is not recommended when function evaluations are     costly or prone to failure.
- Using the ``deactivate`` ``restart_file`` specification will result     in a zero length restart file with the default name ``dakota``.rst.
