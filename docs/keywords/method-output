Blurb::
Control how much method information is written to the screen and output file
Description::
Choose from a total of five output levels during the course of a Dakota study.
If there is no user specification for output verbosity, then the default
setting is ``normal``.

Specific mappings are as follows:

- ``silent`` (i.e., really quiet):   silent iterators, silent model, silent interface, quiet approximation,   quiet file operations
- ``quiet``:   quiet iterators, quiet model, quiet interface, quiet approximation,   quiet file operations
- ``normal``:   normal iterators, normal model, normal interface, quiet approximation,   quiet file operations
- ``verbose``:   verbose iterators, normal model, verbose interface, verbose approximation,   verbose file operations
- ``debug`` (i.e., really verbose):   debug iterators, normal model, debug interface, verbose approximation,   verbose file operations

Note that iterators and interfaces utilize the full granularity in verbosity,
whereas models, approximations, and file operations do not.
With respect to iterator verbosity, different iterators implement this control
in slightly different ways (as described below in the method independent
controls descriptions for each iterator), however the meaning is consistent.

For models, interfaces, approximations, and file operations, ``quiet``
suppresses parameter and response set reporting and ``silent`` further
suppresses function evaluation headers and scheduling output. Similarly,
``verbose`` adds file management, approximation evaluation, and global
approximation coefficient details, and ``debug`` further adds diagnostics
from nonblocking schedulers.
