Select a mutation type for JEGA methods
Description::
Five mutation types are available for selection by keyword:
``replace_uniform``, ``bit_random``, ``offset_cauchy``, ``offset_normal``, and
``offset_uniform``. They are described in greater detail on their
respective keyword pages.

The ``offset_*`` mutators all act by adding a random "offset" to a variable
value. The random amount has a mean of zero in all cases. The size of the offset
is controlled using the ``mutation_scale`` keyword, which is interpreted
differently for each ``offset_*`` type.

The rate of mutations for all types is controlled suing the ``mutation_rate``.
The rate is applied differently in each ``mutation_type``.
