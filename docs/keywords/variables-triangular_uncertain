Aleatory uncertain variable - triangular

Description::
The triangular distribution is often used when one does not have much
data or information, but does have an estimate of the most likely
value and the lower and upper bounds. The number of triangular uncertain
variables, the modes, and the distribution lower and upper bounds are
required specifications, whilevariable descriptors is an optional
specification.

The density function for the triangular distribution is:

.. math:: f(x) = \frac{2(x-L)}{(U-L)(M-L)}

if :math:`L\leq x \leq M` , and

.. math:: f(x) = \frac{2(U-x)}{(U-L)(U-M)}

if :math:`M\leq x \leq U` , and 0 elsewhere. In these equations, :math:`L`  is the lower bound, :math:`U`  is the upper bound,
and :math:`M`  is the mode of the triangular distribution.
