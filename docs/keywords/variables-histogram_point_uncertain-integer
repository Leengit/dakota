Blurb::
Integer valued point histogram variable
Description::
This probability mass function is integer-valued; the abscissa values
must all be integers.  The ``n`` abscissa values are paired with ``n``
``counts`` which indicate the relative frequency (mass) of each integer
relative to the other specified integers.

.. code-block::

    histogram_point_uncertain
      integer = 2
      pairs_per_variable = 2     3
      abscissas          = 3 4   100 200 300
      counts             = 1 1   1   2   1


There are two variables, the first one has two possible integer values
which are equally probable.  The second one has three options, and 200
is twice as probable as either 100 or 300.
