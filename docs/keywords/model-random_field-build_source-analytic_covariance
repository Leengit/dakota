Use an analytic covariance function for the purposes
of generating a random field model.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY.
Description::
As part of the capability to generate a random field representation, the user
needs to specify the data used to generate the random field representation.
If ``analytic_covariance`` is specified, an analytic covariance function will be used to generate instantiations
of a random field over a mesh.
The form of the covariance function must be specified (e.g. ``exponential`` or ``squared_exponential``.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.

*Default Behavior*
Currently, the ``build_source`` that is fully working is the
``dace_method_pointer``.  The others are not fully operational.
