X-convergence tolerance
Description::
``x_conv_tol`` maps to the internal NL2SOL control ``xctol``.
It is the X-convergence tolerance (scaled relative
accuracy of the solution variables).

The internal default is a function of machine epsilon
(as limited by ``function_precision``). The default is selected with a value of -1.
