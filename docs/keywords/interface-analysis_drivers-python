Run Python through a Pybind11-based direct interface - requires a special Dakota build
Description::
Dakota supports :ref:`a library-linked interface to Python <advint:existingdirect>`, but it must be
explicitly enabled when compiling Dakota from source.  Contact the
Dakota users mailing list for assistance building and using Dakota
with these interfaces.

The :ref:`interface-analysis_drivers<interface-analysis_drivers>` keyword specifies a
Python module:function which implements the parameter to
response mapping.  List data structures are the default,
but NumPy is also supported, if enabled in the build.

Batch evaluations ( :ref:`interface-batch<interface-batch>`) are supported through a
list of dictionaries.
