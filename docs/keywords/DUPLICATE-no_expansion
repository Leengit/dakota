Don't allow expansion of the search pattern
Description::
In general, pattern search methods can expand and contract their step
lengths.  SCOLIB pattern search methods contract the step length by
the value ``contraction_factor``, and they expand the step length by
the value (1/contraction_factor).  The ``expand_after_success`` control
specifies how many successful objective function improvements must
occur with a specific step length prior to expansion of the step
length, whereas the ``no_expansion`` flag instructs the algorithm to
forgo pattern expansion altogether.
