Cause Dakota to step toward the failed "target" simulation from a nearby
successful "source"
Description::
When ``failure_capture`` ``continuation`` is enabled and an evaluation fails,
then Dakota will attempt to march incrementally from a previous good evaluation
(the "source") toward the failing one (the "target"). Further details about the
algorithm employed by Dakota are supplied :ref:`here <failure:mitigation:continuation>`.
