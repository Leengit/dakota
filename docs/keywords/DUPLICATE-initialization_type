Specify how to initialize the population
Description::
The ``initialization_type`` defines how the initial population is created
for the GA. There are three types:


- ``simple_random``
- ``unique_random`` (default)
- ``flat_file``

Setting the size for the ``flat_file`` initializer has the effect of
requiring a minimum number of designs to create. If this minimum
number has not been created once the files are all read, the rest are
created using the ``unique_random`` initializer and then the
``simple_random`` initializer if necessary.
