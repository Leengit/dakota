Indicate the type of final statistics to be returned by a UQ method
Description::
In nested execution contexts, an inner UQ method may
return either a final set of QoI statistics (e.g., for optimization of
moments or level mappings over design parameters within optimization under
uncertainty) or a set of performance metrics (e.g., for maximization
of performance over hyper-parameters within model tuning).

*Default Behavior*
Return a final set of QoI statistics.
