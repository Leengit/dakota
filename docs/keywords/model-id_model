Give the model block an identifying name, in case of multiple model blocks
Description::
The model identifier string is supplied with
``id_model`` and is used to provide a unique identifier string for use
within method specifications (refer to the keyword ``model_pointer`` in
any of the methods in the :ref:`method<method>` block, for example:
:ref:`method-list_parameter_study-model_pointer<method-list_parameter_study-model_pointer>`)

This is used to determine which model the method will run.
