Determine how rectangles are subdivided
Description::
The ``division`` specification determines how DIRECT subdivides each
subregion of the search space.

If ``division`` is set to ``major_dimension``, then the dimension
representing the longest edge of the subregion is subdivided (this is
the default). If ``division`` is set to ``all_dimensions``, then all
dimensions are simultaneously subdivided.
