use statistics for the combined expansion within multifidelity refinement
Description::
When performing adaptive refinement in multifidelity UQ
methods, this option adapts based on the statistics for the aggregate
multifidelity expansion.  This approach may incur additional
computational overhead, but ensures that the refinement occurs in the
aggregate multifidelity context.
