Fall back to a numerical solve when needed for mitigation in MFMC
Description::
Conditionally employ a numerical solve for allocation of
samples per model instance within multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC).
The analytic allocation is employed unless a problem is encountered
(mis-ordered model correlations) that requires mitigation.
