Construct a surrogate from multiple existing training points
Description::
Multipoint approximations use data from previous design points to
improve the accuracy of local approximations. The data often
comes from the current and previous iterates of a minimization algorithm.

Currently, only the
Two-point Adaptive Nonlinearity Approximation (TANA-3) method of
:cite:p:`Xu98` is supported with the ``tana`` keyword.

The
truth model to be used to generate the value/gradient data used in the
approximation is identified through the required
``truth_model_pointer`` specification.
