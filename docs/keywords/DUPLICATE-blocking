Complete concurrent evaluation of all evaluations within a batch
Description::
In the ``blocking`` case, all of the concurrent evaluations in the batch must be completed and all results are returned together to the algorithm.



These runs are reproducible, assuming use of the same seed in cases with random number generation.
Topics::

Examples::

- In the specific context of parallel pattern search, if the best of
  these trial points is an improving point, then it becomes the next
  iterate.

- In the specific context of adaptive refinement of Gaussian process
  (GP) models, all look-aheads are replaced with truth data and a new
  set of refinement candidates can then be generated based on the
  updated state of the GP.
