Blurb::
type of statistical metric roll-up for multifidelity UQ methods
Description::
When performing adaptive refinement in multifidelity UQ
methods, one can adapt the expansion for a model level/fidelity based
on its local statistics ( ``active``) or based on the statistics for the
aggregate expansion ( ``combined``).  The latter case may incur
additional computational overhead, but ensures that the refinement
occurs in the aggregate multifidelity context.

*Default Behavior*

Default for multifidelity methods is ``combined`` statistics.
