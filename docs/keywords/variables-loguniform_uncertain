Aleatory uncertain variable - loguniform

Description::

If the logarithm of an uncertain variable :math:`X` has a uniform
distribution, that is :math:`\log X \sim \mathcal{U}(L, U),` then
:math:`X` is distributed with a loguniform distribution. The
distribution lower bound is :math:`L` and upper bound is
:math:`U` The loguniform distribution has the density function:

.. math:: f(x) = \frac{1}{ x \left( \ln U - \ln L) \right) }

..
   TODO: Is above discussion of bounds correct?

Theory::
For some methods, including vector and centered parameter studies, an
initial point is needed for the uncertain variables. When not given
explicitly, these variables are initialized to their means.
