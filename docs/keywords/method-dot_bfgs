DOT BFGS optimization method
Description::
DOT library :cite:p:`Van95` implementation of
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method for unconstrained
optimizaiton.

See :ref:`topic-package_dot<topic-package_dot>` for information common to all ``DOT`` methods.

*DOT requires a separate software license and therefore may not
be available in all versions of Dakota.  CONMIN or OPT++ methods may
be suitable alternatives.*

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:ref:`environment-results_output-hdf5<environment-results_output-hdf5>` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params<hdf5_results-best_params>`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs<hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs>` (when :ref:`responses-objective_functions<responses-objective_functions>`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration<hdf5_results-calibration>` (when :ref:`responses-calibration_terms<responses-calibration_terms>` are specified)
