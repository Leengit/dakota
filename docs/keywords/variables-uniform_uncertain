Aleatory uncertain variable - uniform

Description::
The number of uniform uncertain variables and their distribution lower and upper
bounds are required specifications, while variable descriptors is an optional specification.
The uniform distribution has the density function:

.. math:: f(x) = \frac{1}{U-L},

where

:math:`U`  and :math:`L` are the upper and lower bounds of the uniform distribution, respectively. The mean of the uniform distribution is :math:`\frac{U+L}{2}` 
and the variance is :math:`\frac{(U-L)^2}{12}` .

Topics::
continuous_variables, aleatory_uncertain_variables

Examples::

Theory::
This distribution is a special case of the more general beta distribution.

For some methods, including vector and centered parameter studies, an
initial point is needed for the uncertain variables. When not given
explicitly, these variables are initialized to their means.
