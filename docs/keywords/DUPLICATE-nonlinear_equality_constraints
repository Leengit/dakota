Blurb::
Group to specify nonlinear equality constraints
Description::
Specifies the number of nonlinear equality constraint functions
returned by the interface.

The ``targets`` specification provides the targets for nonlinear
equalities of the form

.. math:: h(x) = h_t

and the defaults for the equality targets enforce a value of ``0``.
for each constraint

.. math:: h(x) = 0.0

The ``scale_types`` and ``scales`` keywords are related to scaling of
:math:`h \left( x \right)` . See the scaling information under specific
methods, e.g., method-\*-scaling for details on how to use this
keyword.
