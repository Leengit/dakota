Blurb::
Explicitly specify the desired subspace size
Description::
This control explicitly indicates the number of basis vectors to retain.
The subspace model will include exactly ``dimension`` variables.

*Default Behavior*

Active for adapted basis.  Not active for active subspace (the number of basis vectors will be chosen by one of the truncation methods).

*Usage Tips*

This control can be helpful when \a a \a priori studies give insight to the appropriate
subspace size.
