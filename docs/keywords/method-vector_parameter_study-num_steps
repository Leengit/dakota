Number of sampling steps along the vector in a vector parameter study
Description::
``num_steps`` defines the number of steps that are taken in the
direction of the vector. The magnitude of each step is determined in
conjuction with the rest of the method specification.

*Default Behavior*

The user is required to specify ``num_steps`` for a vector parameter
study.  There is no default value.

This study performs function evaluations at both ends, making the
total number of evaluations equal to ``num_steps + 1``.

*Usage Tips*

The study has stringent requirements on performing appropriate steps
with any discrete range and discrete set variables.  A ``num_steps``
specification must result in discrete range and set index steps that
are integers: no remainder is currently permitted in the integer step
calculation and no rounding to integer steps will occur.
