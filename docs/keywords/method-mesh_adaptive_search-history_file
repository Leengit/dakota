Name of file where mesh adaptive search records all evaluation points.
Description::
The ``history_file`` is used to specify the name of a file to which
mesh adaptive direct search will write its own list of evaluated
points.

*Default Behavior*

By default, mesh adaptive direct search will write the list of
evaluation points in a file named mads_history.xxxx, where xxxx
corresponds to a randomly generated number. Dakota's output level
controls the method's level of output to file.
