Don't use constraints
Description::
The surrogate constraints in the approximate subproblem can be
selected to be surrogates of the original constraints (
``original_constraints``) or linearized approximations to the surrogate
constraints ( ``linearized_constraints``), or constraints can be omitted
from the subproblem ( ``no_constraints``).
