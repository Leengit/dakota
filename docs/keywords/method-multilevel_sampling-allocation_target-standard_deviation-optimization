Solve the optimization problem for the sample allocation by numerical optimization in the case of sampling estimator targeting the standard_deviation.
Description::
Employ numerical optimization to solve the optimization problem for finding the optimal sample allocation when targeting the standard deviation. This option needs NPSOL (preferred choice) or OPTPP (alternative choice) installed.

Examples::
The following method block

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
            multilevel_sampling
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
       convergence_tolerance = .01
       allocation_target = standard_deviation
        optimization


uses the standard deviation as sample allocation target and solves the resulting optimization problem using numerical optimization.
