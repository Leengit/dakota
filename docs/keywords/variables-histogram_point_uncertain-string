Blurb::
String (categorical) valued point histogram variable
Description::
This probability mass function is string-valued; the abscissa values
must all be strings.  The ``n`` abscissa values are paired with ``n``
``counts`` which indicate the relative frequency (mass) of each string
relative to the other specified strings.

.. code-block::

    histogram_point_uncertain
      string = 2
      pairs_per_variable = 2            3
      abscissas          = 'no' 'yes'   'function1' 'function2' 'function3'
      counts             = 1     1      1           2           1
      descriptors        = 'vote'       'which_function'


Here there are two variables, the first one ('vote') has two possible
string values 'yes' and 'no' which are equally probable.  The second
one has three options for 'which_function', and 'function2' is twice
as probable as 'function1' or 'function3'.
