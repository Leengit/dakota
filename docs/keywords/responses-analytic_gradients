Analysis driver will return gradients
Description::
The ``analytic_gradients`` specification means that gradient
information is available directly from the simulation (finite
differencing is not required). The simulation must return the gradient
data in the Dakota format (enclosed in single brackets;
see :ref:`responses:results`).
for the case of file transfer of data. The ``analytic_gradients`` keyword
is a complete specification for this case.
