Use coordinate directions as search pattern
Description::
The particular form of the search pattern is controlled by the
``pattern_basis`` specification.  If ``pattern_basis`` is ``coordinate``
basis, then the pattern search uses a plus and minus offset in each
coordinate direction, for a total of *2n* function evaluations in the
pattern.  This case is depicted in Figure 5.3 for three coordinate
dimensions.
