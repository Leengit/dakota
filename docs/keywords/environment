Top-level settings for Dakota execution
Description::
The environment section in a Dakota input file is optional.  It
specifies the top-level solution environment, optionally including run
modes, output controls, and identification of the primary iterative
method ( ``top_method_pointer``).  The output-related keywords address
generation of tabular and results data, and precision of
numerical output.

*Run Mode Defaults*

Dakota run phases include ``check``, ``pre_run``, ``run``, and
``post_run``.  The default behavior is to ``pre_run``, ``run``, and
``post_run``, though any or all of these may be specified to select
specific run phases.  Specifying ``check`` will cause Dakota to exit
before any selected run modes.
