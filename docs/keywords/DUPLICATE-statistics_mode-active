use statistics for the active expansion within multifidelity refinement
Description::
When performing adaptive refinement in multifidelity UQ
methods, this option adapts based on the statistics for the active
model level/fidelity.  This approach avoids some computational overhead in some
cases by avoiding expansion roll-up.
