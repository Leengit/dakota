Identify which analytical gradient corresponds to which response
Description::
The ``id_analytic_gradients`` list specifies by
number the functions which have analytic gradients, and the
``id_numerical_gradients`` list specifies by number the functions which
must use numerical gradients. Each function identifier, from 1 through
the total number of functions, must appear once and only once within
the union of the ``id_analytic_gradients`` and
``id_numerical_gradients`` lists.
