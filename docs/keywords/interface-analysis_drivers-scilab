Run Scilab through a direct interface - requires special Dakota build
Description::
Dakota supports :ref:`a library-linked interface to Scilab <advint:scilab>`, but it must be
explicitly enabled when compiling Dakota from source.  Contact the
Dakota users mailing list for assistance building and using Dakota
with these interfaces.

The :dakkw:`interface-analysis_drivers` specifies a Scilab file which
implements the parameter to response mapping.
