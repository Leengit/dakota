Blurb::
Specify which variables block will be included with this model block
Description::
The ``variables_pointer`` is used to specify which variables block will be used
by the model, by cross-referencing with :ref:`variables-id_variables<variables-id_variables>` keyword in
the :ref:`variables<variables>` block.

See :ref:`topic-block_pointer<topic-block_pointer>` for details about pointers.

*Default Behavior*

When a variables pointer is not specified, the model will use the last
variables block parsed from the input file.
