Select a replacement type for SCOLIB evolutionary algorithm ( ``coliny_ea``)
Description::
The replacement_type controls how current populations and newly
generated individuals are combined to create a new population. Each of
the replacement_type selections accepts an associated integer value, which is
specified by the ``replacement_size``:

The random setting creates a new population using (a) ``replacement_size``
randomly selected individuals from the current population, and (b)
``population_size`` - ``replacement_size`` individuals randomly selected from
among the newly generated individuals (the number of which is
optionally specified using ``new_solutions_generated``) that are created
for each generation (using the selection, crossover, and mutation
procedures).

The chc setting creates a new population using (a) the
``replacement_size`` best individuals from the combination of the current
population and the newly generated individuals, and (b)
``population_size`` - ``replacement_size`` individuals randomly selected from
among the remaining individuals in this combined pool. The chc setting
is the preferred selection for many engineering problems.

The elitist (default) setting creates a new population using (a) the
``replacement_size`` best individuals from the current population, (b) and
``population_size`` - ``replacement_size`` individuals randomly selected from
the newly generated individuals. It is possible in this case to lose a
good solution from the newly generated individuals if it is not
randomly selected for replacement; however, the default
``new_solutions_generated`` value is set such that the entire set of newly
generated individuals will be selected for replacement.

Note that ``new_solutions_generated`` is not recognized by Dakota as a
valid keyword unless ``replacement_type`` has been specified.
