Create new population using replacement
Description::
The ``replacement_type`` controls how current populations and newly
generated individuals are combined to create a new population.  Each
of the ``replacement_type`` selections accepts an integer value, which
is referred as the ``replacement_size``:

The ``chc`` setting creates a new population using (a) the
``replacement_size`` best individuals from the *combination* of the
current population and the newly generated individuals, and (b)
``population_size`` - ``replacement_size`` individuals randomly selected
from among the remaining individuals in this combined pool.  The
``chc`` setting is the preferred selection for many engineering problems.
