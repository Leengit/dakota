Set probability of a mutation
Description::
All mutation types have a ``mutation_rate``, which controls the number of
mutations performed. For ``replace_uniform`` and all the ``offset_*`` types,
the number of mutations performed is the product of ``mutation_rate`` and
``population_size``. For ``bit_random``, it's the product of the
``mutation_rate``, number of design variables, and population size
