Fit MLMC sample allocation to control the variance of the estimator for the standard deviation.
Description::
Computes the variance of the sampling estimator for the standard_deviation and fits sample allocation by solving the corresponding optimization problem.
Topics::

Examples::
The following method block

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
            multilevel_sampling
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
       convergence_tolerance = .01
       allocation_target = standard_deviation


uses the standard_deviation as sample allocation target by computing its variance.
