Blurb::
Percentage of evaluations to do to escape local minima.
Description::
The ``variable_neighborhood_search`` keyword is used to set the
percentage (in decimal form) of function evaluations used to escape
local minima.  The mesh adaptive direct search method will try to
perform a maximum of that percentage of the function evaluations
within this more extensive search.

*Default Behavior*

By default, ``variable_neighborhood_search`` is not used.

*Usage Tips*

Using ``variable_neighborhood_search`` results in an increased number
of function evaluations.  If the desired result is a local minimum,
the added cost is of little or no value, so the recommendation is not
to use it.  If the desired result is the best local minimum possible
within a computational budget, then there is value in setting this
parameter.  Note that the higher the value, the greater the
computational cost.  The value should be no greater than 1.0.

The following example shows the syntax used to set
``variable_neighborhood_search``.

    method
      mesh_adaptive_search
        seed = 1234
        variable_neighborhood_search = 0.1
