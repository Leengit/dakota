Specify sub-method by name
Description::
The ``method_name`` keyword is used to specify a sub-method by Dakota method
name (e.g. 'npsol_sqp') rather than block pointer. The method will be executed
using its default settings. The optional ``model_pointer`` specification can be
used to associate a model block with the method.
