Select how Dakota schedules a batch of concurrent function evaluations in a parallel algorithm
Description::
The ``synchronization`` specification can be used to specify
the use of either ``blocking`` or ``nonblocking`` schedulers, where the
former must block until all evaluations are completed and the latter
does not block, returning only the partial set that has been completed
for a particular call to the scheduler.
