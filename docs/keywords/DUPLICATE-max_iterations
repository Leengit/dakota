Number of iterations allowed for optimizers and adaptive UQ methods
Description::
The maximum number of iterations is used as a stopping criterion for
optimizers and some adaptive UQ methods.  If it has not reached any
other stopping criteria first, the method will stop after it has
performed ``max_iterations`` iterations.  In cases where there are
multiple nested iterations to be controlled, ``max_iterations``
generally controls the outer-most context.

*Default Behavior*

Default value is 100.
