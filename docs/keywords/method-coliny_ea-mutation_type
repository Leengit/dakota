Select a mutation type
Description::
The ``mutation_type`` controls what approach is employed in randomly modifying
continuous design variables within the EA population. Each of the mutation
methods generates coordinate-wise changes to individuals, usually by adding a
random variable to a given coordinate value (an ``offset_*`` mutation), but also by
replacing a given coordinate value with a random variable (a ``replace_*``
mutation).

Discrete design variables are always mutated using the ``offset_uniform`` method.
