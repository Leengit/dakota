Specify the number of evaluation servers when Dakota is run in parallel
Description::
The optional ``evaluation_servers`` specification supports user
override of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of
evaluation servers. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired number of
partitions at the evaluation parallelism level. Refer to
ParallelLibrary and the :ref:`Parallel Computing section <parallel>`
for additional information.
